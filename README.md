# Farming Simulator Utilities

Farming Simulator Utilities is an application designed for multiuser save management. It uses Google Disk to store all the saves for FarmingSimulators in it. It makes sure that you always have the latest version of the game and also prevents storing a new version until you upload your version. 

*Simply makes save management easy as pie.*

# How to use it

1. **Download the application**. It is a self-contained application without need to install anything.
1. **Sign in to your Google Account** where you want to store your data to GoogleDrive. *Ideally the GoogleDisk should be dedicated for saves - no other files should be stored in here (not dedicated storing - not tested)*
1. **Insert Save Folder Path** into the application*(using application menu - option number 3)* .This path is used for upload and back up of the save. It is an absolute path into the save folder - *C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2019/savegame1*
1. **Insert Credentials** into application *(using application menu - option number 4)*. Username is used just to identify who is the latest owner of a save.
1. **Ensure validity of provided information** in a Settings Section *(using application menu - option number 5)*
1. **Upload save** *(using application menu - option number 2)* This will upload your very first save to your storage.
1. **Download save** *(using application menu - option number 1)* After successful save you need to download the latest version of the save. This will automatically prevent all the users of downloading your current save. Also prevents from uploading save to the disk. All until you upload your latest version of the save.
